Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

Types of Machine Learning:

1. Supervised Learning:
   - Uses labeled training data
   - Examples: Linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees
   - Applications: Classification, regression

2. Unsupervised Learning:
   - Uses unlabeled data
   - Examples: K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering
   - Applications: Pattern discovery, dimensionality reduction

3. Reinforcement Learning:
   - Learns through interaction with environment
   - Examples: Q-learning, deep Q-networks
   - Applications: Game playing, robotics

Common ML Algorithms:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines
- Neural Networks
- K-Nearest Neighbors

Popular ML Libraries:
- Scikit-learn
